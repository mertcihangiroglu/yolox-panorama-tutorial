    "# yolox models in torchscript format\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows you how to export [yolox](https://github.com/Megvii-BaseDetection/YOLOX) models in [torchscript](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html) format, that later on can be used as an input to [AWS SageMaker Neo](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/neo.html) compilation job or as an [AWS Panorama](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/panorama/latest/dev/index.html) model. For simplicity, we'll use the yolox-s(mall) version, but it should work also for the other model versions. \n",
    "\n",
    "This code is roughly based on the [`tools/export_torchscript.py`](https://github.com/Megvii-BaseDetection/YOLOX/blob/main/tools/export_torchscript.py) script. In order to be compiled by Neo or used by Panorama, the pytorch Sigmoid Linear Unit (SiLU) activation function has to be replaced by a custom implementation, as SiLU is not typically implemented in embedeed runtimes, and the compilation engine Apache TVM does not support it. This idea was taken from the [`tools/export_onnx.py`](https://github.com/Megvii-BaseDetection/YOLOX/blob/main/tools/export_onnx.py) script."
